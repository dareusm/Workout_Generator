Today I will be creating a basic workout generator. I will create classes for each category of workout. A Cardio file/class, a HIIT file/class, a Legs class/file,
a Push day file/class, and a Pull day class/file. Each class will contain a list of workouts that fall under each category. In the main file I will import these files
and import the random python module. I want the random module so that way it will pick a random set of workouts rather than printing the whole list.

Today I will implement the datetime module so that way when the user starts the program it will welcome them with a good morning, good afternoon, or good evening message
depending on what it is where they are located. I will also place the while loop in it's own function in order to clean up the main function. I will also have my program
print a string instead of a list. I will create a new branch in order to try and implement this functionality. Once I complete it, I will merge it to the main branch.
